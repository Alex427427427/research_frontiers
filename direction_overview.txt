Robotics
1. Dexterous, easily remote controllable machines. Applied in high variance dangerous situations requiring capable and adaptive agents.

Intelligence
1. Condensed architecture of human-like Intelligence. Explicitly define, then test with game worlds.

Physics
1. Foundations. Examine the EM and optics that lie at the divergence point of GR and QFT. Seek unrecognised consequences that resolve inconsistencies in all of later physics.
2. Nuclear physics. Antimatter properties and possibility of large scale production. Applicable to making space travel a materially tractable problem.
3. Photonics. For giggles. Don't know what it's good for but more interesting than most areas.
